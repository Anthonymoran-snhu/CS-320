How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The simplest answer is testing. But real testing means putting pride aside and being willing to find mistakes in your own work. The goal is to make sure the code does exactly what it’s supposed to and nothing unexpected. That’s why having an independent testing team can be really helpful they can look at the code without bias. I also think testing should be built into the CI pipeline so it runs automatically with every build. If a test fails, it’s important to fix the issue instead of turning the test off and moving on.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Understanding what users actually want can be tough because they don’t always know how to explain it. I’ve found that asking “why” a few times like with the Five Whys method helps get to the root of what they need. Watching how users interact with other programs can also give a lot of insight into what they like or dislike. Making mock ups or prototypes is another great way to get early feedback and make sure you’re on the right track before building the full product.

How do I approach designing software?

When I start a new project, I try to come in with something simple. I want to really understand what the person’s vision is and why it matters to them. A lot of times, clients don’t know exactly what they want at the beginning, so talking through their ideas helps both sides figure things out. For me, the most important step in designing software is collecting and understanding the requirements it’s what sets the foundation for everything else.
